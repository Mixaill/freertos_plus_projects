This project was is used to develop and maintain the FreeRTOS+TCP network driver for STM32F7xx parts.

The TCP stack is supposed to run on the STM32F7, which will run at 400 Mhz.

Note that the following libraries are included:

- STM32H747_cube/CM7/Drivers/FreeRTOS_V10.3.1
- STM32H747_cube/Drivers/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP
- STM32H747_cube/Drivers/STM32H7xx_HAL_Driver

You may want to replace them with a diferent version.

Any question can be asked at the [FreeRTOS forum](https://forums.freertos.org)
