# freertos_plus_projects

FreeRTOS sample projects using +TCP and/or +FAT

This is a **non-official repository** that publishes some sample projects that were used to develop and test the FreeRTOS+TCP and FreeRTOS+FAT libraries.

Any question can be asked at the [FreeRTOS forum](https://forums.freertos.org)

On 10 Oct 2020: added five Makefile projects:

    plus\sam4e\src
    plus\same70\src
    plus\stm32F40\Src
    plus\stm32F7
    plus\xilinx\RTOSDemo

These projects share the same library sources. The can be compiled under Linux, but with some easy changes, they can be compiled under Windows as well.
Please check the projects `config.mk` file to define the location of you compiler.
